/**
 * The `aw-wizard-completion-step` component can be used to define a completion/success step at the end of your wizard
 * After a `aw-wizard-completion-step` has been entered, it has the characteristic that the user is blocked from
 * leaving it again to a previous step.
 * In addition entering a `aw-wizard-completion-step` automatically sets the `aw-wizard` and all steps inside the `aw-wizard`
 * as completed.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * ```html
 * <aw-wizard-completion-step [stepTitle]="title of the wizard step"
 *    [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: 'navigation symbol', fontFamily: 'navigation symbol font family' }"
 *    (stepEnter)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is entered"
 *    (stepExit)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is exited">
 *    ...
 * </aw-wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```html
 * <aw-wizard-completion-step stepTitle="Step 1" [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: '1' }">
 *    ...
 * </aw-wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
 *
 * With a navigation symbol from the `font-awesome` font:
 *
 * ```html
 * <aw-wizard-completion-step stepTitle="Step 1" [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: '&#xf1ba;', fontFamily: 'FontAwesome' }">
 *    ...
 * </aw-wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
