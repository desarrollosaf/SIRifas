/**
 * The `awWizardCompletionStep` directive can be used to define a completion/success step at the end of your wizard
 * After a [[WizardCompletionStep]] has been entered, it has the characteristic that the user is blocked from
 * leaving it again to a previous step.
 * In addition entering a [[WizardCompletionStep]] automatically sets the `wizard`, and all steps inside the `wizard`,
 * as completed.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * ```html
 * <div awWizardCompletionStep [stepTitle]="title of the wizard step"
 *    [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: 'navigation symbol', fontFamily: 'font-family' }"
 *    (stepEnter)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is entered"
 *    (stepExit)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is exited">
 *    ...
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```html
 * <div awWizardCompletionStep stepTitle="Step 1" [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: '1' }">
 *    ...
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * With a navigation symbol from the `font-awesome` font:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div awWizardCompletionStep stepTitle="Step 1" [navigationSymbol]="{ symbol: '&#xf1ba;', fontFamily: 'FontAwesome' }">
 *    ...
 * </div>
 * ```
